Proxy Firewall

Proxy Firewall is a Python script that provides a firewall functionality for proxy servers. It allows you to control access, filter content, and rate limit requests to ensure secure and controlled communication between clients and destination servers.
Installation

    Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/proxy-firewall.git
     cd proxy-firewall
2:(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3:Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Start the proxy firewall: python script.py --proxy-host <proxy-host> --proxy-port <proxy-port> --destination-host <destination-host> --destination-port <destination-port> --config-file <config-file>
   example: python script.py --proxy-host 127.0.0.1 --proxy-port 8080 --destination-host example.com --destination-port 80 --config-file config.json


    Replace <proxy-host>, <proxy-port>, <destination-host>, <destination-port>, and <config-file> with the appropriate values. The proxy firewall will listen for incoming client connections and provide a menu for configuration and management.

    Menu Options:
        Start Proxy Server: Starts the proxy server and enables the firewall functionality.
        Configure Access Control: Allows you to add or remove IP addresses from the access control list.
        Configure Content Filtering: Not implemented.
        Configure Rate Limiting: Not implemented.
        Save Configuration: Saves the configuration changes made through the menu.
        Exit: Exits the proxy firewall.

    Modify the configuration:

    You can modify the default configuration by editing the config.json file. The config.json file stores the proxy server and destination server details, as well as the access control list.

Logging

The proxy firewall logs events to the firewall.log file. The log file contains detailed information about successful connections, error messages, and configuration changes.
